## From our customers:
> *“Our back-end systems and applications are complex. They need to be. But, for us to expand at the level of growth that we were experiencing, we needed flexibility and alignment throughout our DevOps lifecycle. We weren’t going to get there with our globally distributed development teams sharing static staging environments. We could either tell our DevOps teams to share the keys to the cloud — which wasn’t going to happen — or we could find a solution.”* – **Pavel Eliav, Head of DevOps, Resident**
