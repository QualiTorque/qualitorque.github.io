The Cloud Account is a Torque component that acts as an interface between Torque and the cloud provider. It grants Torque the permission to access the cloud provider and perform different actions in the context of the Torque environment. These include creating a slim management layer that keeps your data safe, creating and managing the environment's cloud resources, and relaying information about the environment's resources from the cloud provider to Torque.
