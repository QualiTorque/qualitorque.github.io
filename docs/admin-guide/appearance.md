__Uploading your logo__

When you upload your own logo, it will replace the existing Torque logo throughout the system. To make sure that your logo looks great in all areas of the system, we recommend uploading all three logo types:

1. Favicon: This is a small icon that appears in the browser tab next to the page title.
2. Wide logo: This logo will appear in the header section of your website or application.
3. Square logo: This logo will appear in places where a square image is needed, such as social media profile pictures.


To upload your logos, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the "Appearance" section in the Administration --> General menu.
- Click the "Browse or drag" link in each logo type section.
- Select the file from your computer that corresponds to the logo type you're uploading.
- Wait for the upload to complete and confirm that the logo has been successfully uploaded.

That's it! By uploading all three logo types, you'll ensure that your brand looks consistent and professional throughout the system.
