## Overview

Managing cloud resources efficiently is critical for modern organizations. Leaving resources running when not in use can lead to significant waste and security risks. Torque's Actions and Workflows provide automated solutions to optimize your cloud infrastructure.

### Why Resource Management Matters

**üí∞ Cost Optimization**
- Prevent unnecessary expenditure with pay-as-you-go billing models
- Reduce cloud spend by up to 60% through automated resource scheduling
- Eliminate forgotten resources that continue accruing costs

**üå± Environmental Sustainability**
- Reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint
- Support corporate sustainability goals
- Minimize unnecessary data center resource usage

**üîí Security Enhancement**
- Reduce attack surface by stopping unused resources
- Mitigate risks from unauthorized access to idle systems
- Implement security-by-default practices

**‚ö° Performance Improvement**
- Free up valuable computing resources for critical workloads
- Improve overall system performance and responsiveness
- Optimize resource allocation across your infrastructure

### Torque's Solution

Torque provides comprehensive resource management through two complementary approaches:

- **üéØ Actions** - Execute immediate operations on specific resources (power on/off, restart, connect)
- **‚è∞ Workflows** - Schedule automated operations across resource groups (daily shutdowns, weekend scaling)

This combination enables both reactive management and proactive automation, ensuring your infrastructure runs efficiently while reducing operational overhead.

## Actions

Torque provides a built-in set of **actions** you can run on specific cloud resources in the environment to stop them and gain the aforementioned benefits. The built-in actions currently available out of the box by Torque are:

### Supported Actions by Resource Type

**Virtual Machines:**
- **Power On** - Start instances
- **Power Off** - Stop instances  
- **Restart** - Reboot instances
- **Connect** - Create RDP/SSH connections directly from Torque UI

**Database Servers:**
- **Stop** - Temporarily stop database instances
- **Start** - Start stopped database instances
- **Delete** - Remove database instances

**Kubernetes Clusters:**
- **Pause** - Scale down to minimum resources
- **Resume** - Scale back to original capacity

### Debugging Actions

For verbose output to debug actions, add this parameter at the account level:
```
SYSTEM_ACTIONS_VERBOSE_MODE=true
```

## Workflows

**Workflows** take actions to the next level by providing scheduled automations that run on all resources of the same type in an environment.

### Common Workflow Examples

- **Daily Shutdowns**: Power-off all VMs in the environment every day at 6PM
- **Weekend Scaling**: Pause (scale to minimum) development Kubernetes clusters every weekend
- **Cost Optimization**: Automatically stop database instances during non-business hours
- **Maintenance Windows**: Schedule restarts during low-usage periods

## How to Execute Actions and Workflows

### Running Actions on Individual Resources

1. **Switch to Resources View** in your environment

import pic2 from '/img/action-and-workflows-2.png';

<img src={pic2} style={{width: 700}} />

2. **Click a resource tile** to select the resource you want to manage

3. **Hover over the relevant action** and click **Run**

4. **Click the action's name** to monitor its progress and view execution details

import pic1 from '/img/action-and-workflows-1.png';

<img src={pic1} style={{width: 700}} />

### Alternative: Running Actions from Orchestration View

:::note
**Grain-Level Actions**
You can also execute actions from the orchestration (grain) view by:
1. Clicking on the grain's options menu (three dots)
2. Selecting the action you want to run

import pic3 from '/img/action-and-workflows-3.png';

<img src={pic3} style={{width: 700}} />
