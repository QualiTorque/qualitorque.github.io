title: Customizing Autogenerated Blueprints
---

In this article, we'll learn how to edit our autogenerated blueprints in Torque. While Torque conveniently autogenerates blueprints out of your assets, these blueprints may be missing some minor details, like the cluster namespace and execution agent to use, Terraform version, Helm commands to run, etc.

:::tip__Note__
Torque only saves the latest version. So if you need versioning, you're welcome to add the modified blueprint to your __/blueprints__ repository.
:::

1. In the __Blueprints__ page, click the suitable autogenerated blueprint. Autogenerated blueprints have "Torque" as their modifier.  
2. Make your changes. You can modify the blueprint YAML directly in Torque, or use the __Copy__ / __Download__ buttons to edit the file using your preferred editor. For details, see [Autogenerated Blueprints](/blueprint-designer-guide/Autogenerated%20Blueprints).

3. Update the blueprint in Torque (if you modified it externally).
4. Click __Save Changes__.

  Torque validates the blueprint and immediately displays any errors in a tooltip next to the blueprint's name.

5. Launch the blueprint from the __Catalog__ to make sure it runs as expected.
