title: Running Your First Workload in Torque
---

## First time?
If youâ€™re new to Torque, we recommend you first try out the examples we prepared for you in the [Sample Space](/getting-started/The%20Sample%20Space). This should get you familiar with the product as a non-admin user.

## Ready to run your own workload?

**To run your first workload in Torque:**

1. Create a space.
2. Connect your asset repositories to Torque.
3. Connect your cloud account.
4. Set up your Kubernetes compute service.
5. Edit your blueprint's settings to tune it to your needs.
  > Your blueprint is ready to run.
