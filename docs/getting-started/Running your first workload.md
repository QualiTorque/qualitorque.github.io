## First time?
If youâ€™re new to Torque, we recommend you first try out the examples we prepared for you in the [Sample Space](/getting-started/The%20Sample%20Space). This should get you familiar with the product as a non-admin user.

## Ready to run your own workload?

**To run your first workload in Torque you'll need to complete the following tasks:**

1. Create a space.
2. Connect your asset repositories to Torque.  
Torque will automatically create blueprints from your assets. You can modify and customize these blueprints for your needs.
3. Connect an agent it to your space. You can use the built-in Quali hosted agent, or install an agent on your own k8s cluster.
**Your blueprint is ready to run !**
