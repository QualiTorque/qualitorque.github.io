title: Discover Your Assets
---

Torque needs access to your relevant git repositories to read your Terraform modules or Helm charts.
Torque supports 3 version control systems: GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket.

Once a repository is connected, Torque will automatically discover the assets in it (Terraform modules and Helm charts) and will ask you to select the assets to be used for the blueprints. After you select the relevant assets, Torque will automatically generate initial blueprints from your assets.

:::tip __Note__:

Click on an autogenerated blueprint to view the resulting yaml file. You can customize it and edit it if needed. See [Auto-Generated bluperints](/blueprint-designer-guide/Autogenerated%20Blueprints.md) for more details.
