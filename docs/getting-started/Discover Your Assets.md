title: Discover Your Assets
---

Torque needs access to your relevant git repositories to read your Terraform modules or Helm charts.
Torque supports 4 version control systems: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure DevOps.

Once a repository is connected, Torque will automatically discover the assets in it (Terraform modules, Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, CloudFormation templates, and batch scripts). See the full list [here](/overview/supported-platforms.md) and will ask you to select the assets to be used for the blueprints. After you select the relevant assets, Torque will automatically generate initial blueprints from your assets.

:::tip __Note__:

Click an autogenerated blueprint to view the resulting yaml file. You can customize it and edit it if needed. See [Auto-Generated bluperints](/blueprint-designer-guide/Autogenerated%20Blueprints.md) for more details.

**To connect your repository:**
1. Go to your space, and select __Repositories__ from the left pane. 
2. Click **Add a Repository** and follow the instructions.

  To connect an Azure DevOps repo, use this format: "https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_git/{repositoryName}".
3. Now that your repository is connected, click __Discover Assets__ to have Torque auto-generate blueprints out of the suitable assets.
