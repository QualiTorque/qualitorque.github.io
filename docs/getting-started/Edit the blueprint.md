## Torque Autogenerated Blueprints
Torque autogenerates blueprints to provide you with a quickstart, based on your assets (Terraform modules, Helm Charts). You may need to edit the blueprint and adjust it to your specific needs.

### Terraform Augogenerated Blueprint

- **spec_version** : should not be changed.
- **description** : may be changed to a better description for your blueprint.
- **inputs** : Torque generates the inputs based on the inputs in your module. The blueprint inputs will be presented to the end user when they launch the blueprint and deploy the environment, so they can fill out the inputs and/or override any defaults. These inputs will be the module's inputs upon deployment. 

:::tip Note:

Torque currently supports only simple types as blueprint inputs for terraform (string, boolean and numbers). The inputs that were autogenerated for you are all simple types inputs from your module.

:::

Remove any inputs which you don't want to be exposed when the blueprint is deployed as an environment.

- **outputs** : Torque generates the outputs based on the outputs of your module. The blueprint outputs will be presented to the end user when they are ready (after the environment was deployed). 

Remove any inputs outputs you don't want to be exposed when the blueprint is deployed as an environment.

-- **tf-version** : The terraform version that will be used to deploy the module. Change it according to your needs. 

### Helm Augogenerated Blueprint

- **spec_version** : should not be changed.
- **description** : may be changed to a better description for your blueprint.
- **inputs** : Torque generates the inputs based on the values.yaml file found in your chart. The blueprint inputs will be presented to the end user when they launch the blueprint and deploy the environment, so they can fill out the inputs and/or override any defaults. These inputs will be provided to the chart as override values.yaml upon deployment. 

:::tip Note:

Torque currently supports only simple types as blueprint inputs for helm (string, boolean and numbers). The inputs that were autogenerated for you are all simple types inputs from your module. However, you can reference nested values, for example:
