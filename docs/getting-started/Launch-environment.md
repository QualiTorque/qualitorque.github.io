title: Launch Your Blueprint
---

At this point, you have done the following:
* Created a space
* Connected an asset repository and autogenerated blueprints out of some assets
* Created an agent that will handle the deployment and teardown of the environments in the Kubernetes cluster

You are now ready to launch your first environment.

1. Open your space.
2. In the __Blueprints__ page, __Publish__ a suitable autogenerated blueprint.
3. In the __Catalog__, __Launch__ the blueprint.
4. Specify the environment's inputs.
5. Optionally assign collaborators to the environment. While everyone in the space has "read" permission to its environments, only the environment's owner and collaborators can perform actions that change the environment: extend end the environment, reconcile or update resource changes, etc. When launching the environment, the new owner/collaborators will receive a notification email if you have [Notifications](/admin-guide/notifications) configured in the space.
6. Click __Next__, specify the environment's inputs and tags, and click __Launch__.
   
   If the space has an approval policy, your environment will enter a "Pending" state while you wait to get approval from a moderator. Click __View Request__ to view or cancel your request.

4. Wait until the environment is active and use as needed. URLs to the environment's applications are typically provided as outputs - these can be found in the environment's __Quicklinks__ on the right, or in the __Parameters__ pane.

5. Check out the __Resources__ pane to get details about your environment's resources. Use this tab to understand what assets each grain spun up, get connection details to specific resources, and more.

:::tip __Tip__:

If someone makes changes to the blueprint's asset or the environment's cloud resources while the environment is running, you will see an __Updates Available__ link in the environment page. Click it to view and resolve the changes. It has two sections: 
* __Updates__ shows changes made to the asset's definition file, allowing you to optionally update the environment
* __Drift Detection__ shows any of the environment's resources that were modified externally. Click the error to see the modifications, and __Reconcile__ to revert a resource back to its original state.
