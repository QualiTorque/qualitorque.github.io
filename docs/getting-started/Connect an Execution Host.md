title: Connect an Execution Host
---

Next, let's connect an execution host to Torque. The execution host is a system or location where the IaC executable will run. For example, a kubernets cluster can be used as an execution host, and the IaC commands such as "terraform apply" or "helm install" would be run from the cluster.

Supported types of hosts:
