title: Connect an Execution Host
---

Next, let's connect an execution host to Torque. The execution host is the platform on which the asset will be launched. For example, a Kubernetes cluster can be used as an execution host, and the commands such as `terraform apply` or `helm install` would be run from the cluster.

:::tip Note:
The infrastructure resources of the environment may be deployed to other clouds or platforms.
