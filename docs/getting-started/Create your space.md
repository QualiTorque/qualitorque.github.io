As we discussed in [The Sample Space](/getting-started/The%20Sample%20Space), the space is your work area and here you work with your team on a project. It will contain the team members, repositories, assets, and clouds.

**To create a space:** 

1. Access the **Admin Console**.

2. Click **Spaces** > **Create space** and follow the instructions.  
**Congratulations! You have created your first space in Torque. Now, connect your asset repository. **
