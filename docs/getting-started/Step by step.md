### Step #1: Create your account
Your Torque journey starts with creating a Torque account. This account will serve your organization with your application development needs. As the creator of the account, you are the Account Owner, which basically means you're a super admin that can also create other account admins.

1. Go to [https://portal.qtorque.io/login](https://portal.qtorque.io/login).
2. Click __Create an Account__.
3. Register with your git user or email address, and follow the instructions on the screen.
   
   The Welcome page is displayed, prompting you to launch a sample environment. To help you gauge the value of Torque, we've set up a __Sample__ space (top-left cornder of the screen) containing various fully-defined blueprints you can play around with.

4. Click __Let's Get Started__ to start the onboarding process.

5. Click the checklist at any time to check your progress.

### Step #2: Understanding the Sample Space

Torque comes out of the box with a single space - the __Sample__ space. This space contains several example blueprints for you to play with and get familiarized with the product.
Launch one or more of the examples to understand how the end users would experience Torque:

  * Define the environment's duration or end time - all resources are automatically torn down when the duration expires. 
  * Fill in inputs (the inputs that can be provided are defined in the blueprint).
  * View the deployment logs.
  * Extend the duration of the environment or end it before the duration expires.
  * View the expected and actual cloud cost of the environment. 
  * Get the deployment's output.
  * See the tags that the environment deployed on the cloud resources.

_To launch a sample, go to the __Sample__ space, click __Environments__ and then click __New Sandbox__._



### Step #4: Launch your first environment

At this point, you have done the following:
* Created a space
* Connected an asset repository and autogenerated blueprints out of some assets
* Created an agent that will handle the deployment and teardown of the environments in the Kubernetes cluster

You are now ready to launch your first environment.

1. Open your space.
2. In the __Blueprints__ page, __Publish__ a suitable autogenerated blueprint.
3. In the __Catalog__, __Launch__ the blueprint.
4. Specify the environment's inputs.
5. Optionally assign collaborators to the environment. While everyone in the space has "read" permission to its environments, only the environment's owner and collaborators can perform actions that change the environment: extend end the environment, reconcile or update resource changes, etc. When launching the environment, the new owner/collaborators will receive a notification email if you have [Notifications](/admin-guide/notifications) configured in the space.
6. Click __Next__, specify the environment's inputs and tags, and click __Launch__.
   
   If the space has an approval policy, your environment will enter a "Pending" state while you wait to get approval from a moderator. Click __View Request__ to view or cancel your request.

7. Wait until the environment is active and use as needed. URLs to the environment's applications are typically provided as outputs - these can be found in the environment's __Quicklinks__ on the right, or in the __Parameters__ pane.

8. Check out the __Resources__ pane to get details about your environment's resources. Use this tab to understand what assets each grain spun up, get connection details to specific resources, and more.
