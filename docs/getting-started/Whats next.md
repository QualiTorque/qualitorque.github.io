By now, you have succeeded to run your first workload with Torque. To take it to the next level, download your autogenerated blueprints, and store them in your VCS of choice. It may reside in the same repository with your assets, or a diffrent one. 
Then, connect the repository containing your blueprints to Torque as a *Blueprint Repository*. Go to your space settings page, and click on repositories tab. Follow the instructions to add a blueprint repository. 

Continue developing your blueprints to enjoy the full capabilities of Torque, such as multi-grain, multi-techology blueprints, with advanced automation and orchestration capabilities. Working in your VCS will allow you to deploy GitOps processes to your blueprint development.
