By now, you have succeeded to run your first workload with Torque, set up your deployment with an agent, and have added your IaC assets as autogenerated blueprints to Torque. 

Continue developing your blueprints to enjoy the full capabilities of Torque, such as multi-grain, multi-techology blueprints, with advanced automation and orchestration capabilities. Working in your VCS will allow you to deploy GitOps processes to your blueprint development.
