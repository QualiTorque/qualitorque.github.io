# Custom Resources Use Cases

This page explores practical use cases where Custom Resources provide significant value in managing infrastructure and application deployments. Each use case includes the business context, technical requirements, and implementation approach.

## Use Cases
### Test Environment Management

**Business Context**
Development teams need consistent access to test environments, but physical/virtual resources are limited and expensive. Teams often face conflicts when multiple projects need the same type of testing infrastructure simultaneously.

**Challenges**
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple teams competing for limited test servers
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensuring test environments match production specifications
- **Cost Management**: Optimizing resource utilization to control costs
- **Tracking**: Knowing which resources are allocated to which projects

**Solution with Custom Resources**

```yaml
resources:
  test_server:
    selector:
      type: Test_Environment_Pool
      quantity: '1'
      attributes:
        - server_type: "web" # database, cache
        - cpu_cores: 2 # 4, 8, 16
        - memory_gb: 8 # 16, 32, 64
        - os_type: "linux" # windows
        - location: "us-east-1" # us-west-2, eu-west-1
```

**Benefits**:
- **Automatic Allocation**: Blueprints automatically reserve appropriate test servers
- **Resource Visibility**: Clear tracking of which resources are in use
- **Standardization**: Consistent environment specifications across teams
- **Conflict Prevention**: No more manual coordination between teams

### Database Connection Pool Management

**Business Context**
Applications require database connections, but connection limits and database resource management require careful coordination. Different environments (dev/staging/prod) have different database instances with varying capabilities.

**Challenges**
- **Connection Limits**: Databases have maximum connection limits that must be respected
- **Environment Isolation**: Ensuring applications connect to appropriate database tiers
- **Resource Tracking**: Understanding database utilization across applications
- **Configuration Management**: Managing different connection strings and parameters

**Solution with Custom Resources**

```yaml
resources:
  database:
    selector:
      type: Database_Pool
      quantity: '1'
      attributes:
        - database_type: "mysql" # "postgresql", "oracle", "mongodb"
        - environment_tier: "dev" # "staging", "prod"
        - connection_string: Full connection URL
        - performance_tier: "basic" # "standard", "premium"
```

**Benefits**:
- **Automatic Environment Matching**: Applications get appropriate database tier
- **Connection Management**: Prevents exceeding database connection limits
- **Environment Consistency**: Standardized database configurations
- **Dependency Tracking**: Clear visibility into application-database relationships

### Kubernetes Cluster Resource Management

**Business Context**
Organizations running multiple Kubernetes clusters need to efficiently allocate cluster resources to different teams and projects while maintaining isolation and resource limits.

**Challenges**
- **Cluster Capacity**: Understanding available resources across multiple clusters
- **Team Isolation**: Ensuring teams don't interfere with each other's workloads
- **Resource Optimization**: Maximizing cluster utilization while maintaining performance
- **Multi-Cluster Management**: Coordinating deployments across different clusters

**Solution with Custom Resources**

```yaml
resources:
  k8s_resources:
    selector:
      type: K8s
      attributes:
        - cluster_name: Target Kubernetes cluster
        - region: Cluster geographic region
```

**Benefits**:
- **Resource Isolation**: Each project gets dedicated namespaces with resource limits
- **Capacity Planning**: Clear visibility into cluster resource allocation
- **Multi-Cluster Support**: Automatic selection of appropriate clusters
- **Policy Enforcement**: Consistent security and resource policies

### CI/CD Pipeline Resource Allocation

**Business Context**
CI/CD pipelines require dedicated build agents and runners, but these resources are expensive and need to be shared efficiently across multiple teams and projects.

**Challenges**
- **Agent Availability**: Ensuring build agents are available when needed
- **Resource Specialization**: Different builds require different agent capabilities
- **Queue Management**: Preventing build queues from blocking critical deployments
- **Cost Control**: Optimizing agent utilization to minimize costs

**Benefits**:
- **Intelligent Allocation**: Pipelines get appropriate agents for their requirements
- **Resource Optimization**: Better utilization of expensive build infrastructure
- **Build Reliability**: Consistent, predictable build environments
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents and distribute load

---

### Network Resource Management

**Business Context**
Complex applications require specific network configurations, IP addresses, VLANs, and firewall rules. Manual network management leads to conflicts and security issues.

**Challenges**
- **IP Address Conflicts**: Preventing duplicate IP assignments
- **Network Segmentation**: Ensuring proper network isolation
- **Firewall Management**: Coordinating firewall rules across environments
- **Compliance**: Meeting network security and compliance requirements

**Benefits**:
- **Automatic IP Management**: No more IP address conflicts
- **Security Consistency**: Standardized firewall and security configurations
- **Compliance Assurance**: Automatic application of compliance policies
- **Network Visibility**: Clear tracking of network resource allocation

---

### License Management

**Business Context**
Software licenses are expensive and often have strict usage limits. Organizations need to track and optimize license utilization across different projects and environments.

**Challenges**
- **License Compliance**: Ensuring license usage stays within limits
- **Cost Optimization**: Maximizing value from expensive license investments
- **Usage Tracking**: Understanding which projects use which licenses
- **Audit Preparation**: Maintaining accurate license usage records

**Benefits**:
- **Automatic Compliance**: Prevents over-allocation of licenses
- **Usage Optimization**: Better visibility into license utilization
- **Cost Management**: Data-driven license purchase decisions
- **Audit Readiness**: Comprehensive license usage tracking

### Disaster Recovery and Backup Resources

**Business Context**
Applications need backup and disaster recovery capabilities, but these resources must be coordinated to avoid conflicts and ensure compliance with recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).

**Challenges**
- **Backup Window Management**: Coordinating backup schedules to avoid conflicts
- **Storage Allocation**: Managing backup storage across multiple systems
- **Recovery Testing**: Regular testing of disaster recovery procedures
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meeting regulatory backup and retention requirements

#### Cross-Cutting Benefits
