# The Sample Space

Torque comes out of the box with a single space - the "Sample" space. This space containes several example blueprints for you to try and get familiar with the product.
Launch one or more of the examples to understand how the end users would experience Torque:

  * Define a duration or end time to the environment - all resources will be automaticallt torn down when the duration expires. 
  * Fill in inputs (the inputs which can be provided in deploy time are defined in the blueprint)
  * View the deployment logs
  * Extend the duration of the environments or end it before the duration expires
  * View the expected and actual cost of the environment 
  * Get the outputs from the deployment
  * See the tags which the environment deployed on the cloud resources
