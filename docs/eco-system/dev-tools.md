To assist you with your blueprint development activities, we've created the following development tools. For details, see [Quali Torque CLI](https://pypi.org/project/torque-cli/.)

## Torque CLI 

This tool streamlines the YAML development process by validating changes in real-time and allowing the execution of test sandboxes directly from the development branch, without needing to first merge the changes to production.

## Torque VSCode plugin

This extension facilitates the blueprint/application/service yaml development process by providing developers with autocomplete, instant error checks and schema validations.
