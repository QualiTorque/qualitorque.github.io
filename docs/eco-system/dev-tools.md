To assist you with your blueprint development activities, we've created the following development tools.

## Torque CLI 

This tool streamlines the YAML development process by validating changes in real-time and allowing the execution of test sandboxes directly from the development branch, without needing to first merge the changes to production. For details, see [Quali Torque CLI](https://pypi.org/project/torque-cli/).

## Torque VSCode plugin

This extension facilitates the blueprint yaml development process by providing developers with autocomplete, instant error checks and schema validations. For details, see [VS Code Extension for Torque](https://github.com/QualiTorque/torque-vs-code-extensions).

For example: Auto-completion suggestions for inputs, parameters and variables:
