title: Integrations Overview
---

Torque supports three types of integrations: 
* CI/CD tools for consuming environments as part of your DevOps pipeline
* Issue trackers and collaboration apps for communicating environment lifecycle events to your teams 
* Development tools that assist you to develop Torque blueprints. 

Integrations are configured on the space level, allowing each space admin to set up the integrations and capabilties to their team and project.
