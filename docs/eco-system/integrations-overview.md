---

Torque supports three types of integrations: 
* Development tools that assist you to develop Torque blueprints.
* Issue trackers and notification (collaboration) apps for communicating environment lifecycle events to your teams 
* CI/CD tools for consuming environments as part of your DevOps pipeline

Integrations are configured on the **Space** level allowing each space admin to set up the integrations and capabilties to their team and project.
