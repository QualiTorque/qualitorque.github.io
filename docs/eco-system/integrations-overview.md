title: Integrations Overview

Torque supports two types of integrations: CI/CD tools for consuming environments as part of your DevOps pipeline, and development tools that assist you to develop Torque blueprints. Integrations are configured on the space level, allowing each space admin to set up the integrations and capabilties to their team and project.
