title: The Environment YAML
---

Environment as Code (EaC) allows you to define and manage Torque environments using YAML files. If you know how to write Torque blueprints, you can write EaC YAML files. The structure of an EaC YAML file is similar to a blueprint, with the addition of an 'environment' section that defines the properties of the specific environment instance.

## Environment Discovery

Environment YAML files must be placed under the 'environments' directory in the repository. Torque periodically scans this directory for environment YAML files and stores them internally.

:::note
Environments are written in YAML files that reside in an __/environments__ folder within a source control repository onboarded to Torque (the folder name is case-sensitive and must be "environments"). Environments kept in the __/environments__ folder must be of type ".yaml" and not ".yml" to be used in Torque.
:::

The directory structure should be as follows:

```bash
environments/
    production.yaml
    staging.yaml
    devbox.yaml
```

When a new environment YAML file is detected or an existing one is modified, Torque performs validations on the file. If the file is valid, a snapshot is saved, which will be used to create or reconcile the environment. If the file is invalid, it will not affect the existing snapshot or the environment.

If a user modifies the environment YAML file, the changes will be applied to the corresponding environment.

Possible applicable changes:
- Add/remove grains
- Change commit/tag
- Environment inputs
- Grain inputs

:::info
All sources must contain a commit hash or tag.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of a Torque environment YAML file:

```yaml
spec_version: 2

environment:
  environment_name: eac-env-name
  owner_email: me@quali.com
  state: active
  labels:
    label-key: label-value
    label-key2: # for "value only" labels
     
inputs:
  agent:
    type: agent
    default: production-k8s

  tf_input:
    type: string
    default: default_input
    
outputs:
  tf_output: 
    value: '{{ .grains.tf1.outputs.output2 }}'
    quick: true
    
grains:
  tf1:
    kind: terraform
    tf-version: 1.5.5
    spec:
      source:
        store: iac-repo
        path: terraform/complex-references1
        tag: v1.0.1 
      agent:
        name: '{{ .inputs.agent }}'
      inputs:
        - test_input1: '{{ .inputs.tf_input }}'
        - test_input2: "input2"
      outputs:
        - output2

  tf2:
    kind: terraform
    tf-version: 1.5.5
    spec:
      source:
        store: iac-repo
        path: terraform/complex-references2
        tag: v1.0.2
      agent:
        name: '{{ .inputs.agent }}'
      inputs:
        - test_input1: '{{.inputs.tf_input}}'
        - test_input2: "input2"
      outputs:
        - output2
      scripts: 
        pre-tf-init:
          source:
            store: scripts-repo
            path : scripts/user_script.sh
          arguments: "value"
        pre-tf-destroy:
          source:
            store: scripts-repo
            path : scripts/user_script.sh
          arguments: "value"
  
  bp1:
    kind: blueprint
    spec:
      source:
        store: iac-repo
        path: blueprints/building-block.yaml
        tag: official-1.0.1
      inputs:
        - agent: '{{ .inputs.agent }}'
```

In this example, the `environment` section defines the environment name, description, owner email, and state. The `inputs` and `outputs` sections define the environment-level inputs and outputs, respectively.

The `grains` section contains the list of grains that make up the environment, similar to a blueprint. Each grain specifies its kind (e.g., `terraform`, `blueprint`, etc.), version, and other configuration details specific to that grain type.

By following this structure, users can define and manage their environments as code, allowing for version control, collaboration, and automated deployments using Torque's Environment as Code (EaC) functionality.

## Environment section

The environment section contains all of the specific data related to the environment instance. This is the main configuration block that defines how the environment should be created and managed.

```yaml
environment:
  environment_name: eac-env
  description: eac example
  owner_email: me@quali.com
  state: active # desired state: active/inactive
  collaborators: 
    collaborators_emails:
      - collaborator1@quali.com
      - collaborator2@quali.com
    collaborators_groups:
      - Group1
      - Group2
  spaces:
    - spaceA
    - spaceB
  tags:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
```

## Environment Spec Reference

### `environment_name`

The unique name identifier for the environment. This field is required and must be unique within the space.

```yaml
environment:
  environment_name: my-production-env
```

### `description`

An optional description providing additional context about the environment's purpose or contents.

```yaml
environment:
  description: "Production environment for web application"
```

### `owner_email`

The email address of the environment owner. This field is required and must be a valid email address of a user in the Torque system.

```yaml
environment:
  owner_email: admin@company.com
```

:::info
Updating the owner email does not update the owner of active environments. Owner changes only apply to new environment deployments.
:::

### `state`

The desired state of the environment. Possible values are:
- `active`: The environment should be running and available
- `inactive`: The environment should be stopped/terminated

```yaml
environment:
  state: active
```

### `collaborators`

Defines users and groups that have collaborative access to the environment. Collaborators can view and potentially modify the environment based on their permissions.

```yaml
environment:
  collaborators: 
    collaborators_emails:
      - user1@company.com
      - user2@company.com
    collaborators_groups:
      - Developers
      - QA-Team
```

**Sub-fields:**
- `collaborators_emails`: List of email addresses for individual users
- `collaborators_groups`: List of group names that should have collaborative access

### `spaces`

Specifies which Torque spaces this environment belongs to. Environments can be associated with multiple spaces for organization and access control purposes.

```yaml
environment:
  spaces:
    - development
    - testing
    - staging
```

### `tags`

Key-value pairs for categorizing and organizing environments. Tags can be used for filtering, reporting, and applying policies.

```yaml
environment:
  tags:
    project: web-app
    team: backend
    cost-center: engineering
    environment-type: production
```

### `labels`

Similar to tags but used specifically for workflow attachment and selection. Labels help determine which workflows are available for this environment.

```yaml
environment:
  labels:
    application: web-service
    tier: production
    region: us-east-1
```

### `duration`

Specifies the maximum lifetime of the environment. The environment will be automatically terminated after this duration expires.

```yaml
environment:
  duration: PT4H  # ISO 8601 duration format (4 hours)
```

**Supported formats:**
- ISO 8601 duration format (e.g., `PT1H30M` for 1 hour 30 minutes)
- Hours format (e.g., `4h` for 4 hours)
- Minutes format (e.g., `120m` for 120 minutes)

### `auto_approve`

Controls whether the environment deployment should proceed automatically without requiring manual approval, even if approval policies are configured.

```yaml
environment:
  auto_approve: true  # Default: false
```

### `blueprint_commit`

Specifies a specific commit hash or tag for the blueprint source, allowing for precise version control of the environment definition.

```yaml
environment:
  blueprint_commit: "abc123def456"  # Commit hash
  # OR
  blueprint_commit: "v2.1.0"       # Tag
```

## EaC Management APIs

Torque provides REST APIs for managing Environment as Code (EaC) files and their associated environments. These APIs allow you to control the lifecycle and behavior of EaC-managed environments.

### Enable/Disable EaC Record

Control whether the reconcile loop processes a specific EaC file. When disabled, the reconcile loop will skip the EaC file and will not launch or modify environments based on its contents.

**Endpoint:**
```
PUT /api/spaces/{space_name}/eac/enable
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "eac_path": "environments/production.yaml",
  "enable": true
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `eac_path` (string, required): The full path identifier of the EaC file in the Git repository
- `enable` (boolean, required): Set to `true` to enable processing, `false` to disable

**Behavior:**
- **Enabled (default)**: New EaC files are enabled by default. The reconcile loop will process the file and apply any changes
- **Disabled**: The reconcile loop will skip this EaC file and will not attempt to launch or modify environments based on its contents

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://portal.qtorque.io/api/spaces/my-space/eac/enable" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "eac_path": "environments/staging.yaml",
    "enable": false
  }'
```

### Detach EaC Environment

Detach an EaC-managed environment so that it will no longer be subject to changes that occur in the EaC file. The environment becomes a regular environment that is managed independently.

**Endpoint:**
```
PUT /api/spaces/{space_name}/environments/{eac_env_id}/eac/detach
```

**Parameters:**
- `space_name` (string, required): The name of the space containing the environment
- `eac_env_id` (string, required): The ID of the EaC-managed environment to detach

**What happens when detaching:**
1. The associated EaC file is automatically disabled
2. The environment ID is removed from the EaC record in the database
3. The EaC path reference is removed from the environment state
4. The environment continues to run but is no longer managed by the EaC file

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://portal.qtorque.io/api/spaces/my-space/environments/env-123/eac/detach" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Terminate EaC Environment

Terminate an EaC-managed environment, which automatically detaches it first and then terminates the environment.

**Endpoint:**
```
DELETE /api/spaces/{space_name}/environments/{eac_env_id}/eac
```

**Parameters:**
- `space_name` (string, required): The name of the space containing the environment
- `eac_env_id` (string, required): The ID of the EaC-managed environment to terminate

**Query Parameters:**
- `interrupt` (boolean, optional): Set to `true` to force termination, `false` for graceful termination (same as normal environment termination)

**What happens when terminating:**
1. The environment is first detached (same process as the detach API)
2. The environment is then terminated following the normal termination process

**Example:**
```bash
# Graceful termination
curl -X DELETE "https://portal.qtorque.io/api/spaces/my-space/environments/env-123/eac" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Force termination
curl -X DELETE "https://portal.qtorque.io/api/spaces/my-space/environments/env-123/eac?interrupt=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### Use Cases

**Development Workflow:**
1. **Disable EaC during maintenance**: Temporarily disable an EaC file while making significant changes to prevent unwanted deployments
2. **Detach for customization**: Detach an environment when you need to make manual changes that shouldn't be overwritten by the EaC file
3. **Clean termination**: Use the terminate API to properly clean up EaC environments and their associations

**Production Management:**
- Disable EaC files for environments that require manual oversight
- Detach environments before performing manual maintenance or testing
- Use terminate for clean decommissioning of EaC-managed environments

:::warning
Once an environment is detached from its EaC file, it cannot be re-attached. The environment becomes a standard Torque environment and must be managed manually or through regular APIs.
