title: What is the Torque Agent? 
---

The Torque agent is a small piece of code which is installed on your cloud and is used to communicate between your Torque SAAS tenant and your cloud.
The agent uses only outbound communication with Torque SAAS. The agent is stateless and very thin.
The agent is "always on" and runs all the time, checking with Torque for new tasks to perform.

When the agent receives a message about a new task (launch an environment) it will spawn one or more runners that will launch the specific grain and then terminate. Runners may not need to be spawned if a suitable runner is already running.

The following diagram depicts the connectivity between the agent and Torque SAAS:
