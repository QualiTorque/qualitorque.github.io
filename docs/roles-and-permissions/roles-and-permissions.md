title: Users, Roles and Permissions

Now that you understand how Torque works, it's time to invite other members of your team to your Torque account. As Account Admin, you can invite users to your Torque account and add them to spaces, while Space Admins can only add existing Torque users to the spaces they administer. 

There are two account-level roles: Account Admins and Account Members. Account Admins have full administrative permissions across the entire account and all spaces. Account Members also have a space role assigned to them for each space, which determines their permissions in that space. As such, the same user can have different roles in different spaces.
