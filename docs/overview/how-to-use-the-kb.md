Before you start, please familiarize yourself with the [Main Concepts](/overview/The%20Torque%20Terminology) of Torque.

If you're new to Torque or perhaps need a refresher course, please follow the [Getting Started](/getting-started/Create%20an%20account) procedure to set up your Torque account for the first time and start deploying environments.
