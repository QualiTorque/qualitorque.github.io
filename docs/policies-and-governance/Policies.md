As the blueprint designer, you can define the blueprint's max duration or allow it to run indefinitely, to support scenarios that deploy a sandbox that must be always online, or delivers a static cloud resource.

**To set the blueprint's policy:** 

1. In the **"Blueprints** page, clic the blueprint's more actions menu and select **Policies**. 
2. Set the max duration or select **Unlimited** to allow the sandbox end user to run the sandbox indefinitely.

**Note**: You can end or extend the sandbox at any time, regardless of its runtime policy.
