# The Cost Report

The cost report provides detailed insights into how each business application contributes to your overall cloud bill, covering all your cloud accounts and clusters. It also shows how these costs are distributed among the various teams and divisions within your organization.

Within this report, you can get a comprehensive understanding of:
- Your current and historical cloud spend
- Your [realized savings (achieved by Torque)](#realized-savings-report)
- Your [potential savings](#potential-savings-report) and and strategies to achieve them

This report empowers you to answer key questions such as:
