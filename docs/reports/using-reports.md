## Time filter ##
> ![Locale Dropdown](/img/reports-filter.png)

On the top of every report you can find the **filter**. 
- **Time range** controls the total time frame that will be presented in the report.
- **Time scope** controls the grouping of events into smaller buckets of time.
- **Space** allows you to filter a specific space. The entire data in the report will be filtered. This is relevant only to account level reports. Space level reports are already filtered by the space.
- **ENV_ID** allows you to focus on a single environment throughout the report.
