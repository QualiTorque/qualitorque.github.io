It leverages your existing IaC and container files from technological platforms, such as Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests, Helm, as well as your own bash/python scripts for enhanced flexibility and configuration. Torque ingests these by connecting to and scanning your git source control repositories, and turns them into blueprints, which can be used as single-asset blueprints, or added as building blocks in multi-asset blueprints.
