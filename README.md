# Torque Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.


```
$ npm run build
```

This command starts a local build of the project. When it completes successfully, you can run the built project using "npm run serve". This is good for testing both the build process and the generated production result.
